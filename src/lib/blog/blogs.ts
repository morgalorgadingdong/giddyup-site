                    `3pm - Pit stop numero dos. I consider buying gas station food but think better of it when I remember I’ve done nothing but sit in the back of the sprinter all day. *insert “I don’t need it* Spongebob meme*`,
                    `3pm - 6pm - Start trying to pin down where we’ll set up camp for the night. We use a few apps for this (freeroam, iOverlander are two of my favorites), as well as the good ol’ googles.`,
                    `6pm - Set up camp. Mom makes drinks, Dad makes one of his many delicious keto dinners (I know “delicious keto dinner” sounds like an oxymoron but they’ve been keto for 3 years and man do they have this shit down).`,
                    `9pm - We go to bed, which is shockingly early considering the time change and lack of physical exercise we’re all getting.`
